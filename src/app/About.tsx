    Hey, I'm Udemeobong! I'm a mechanical engineer turned fullstack developer. 
<br className='pt-2'/>
    Why did i make the transition ?  
   <br />
<p>

As a former project and site engineer supervising over a hundred technicians and engineers, I didnt enjoy working on sites or designing mechanical systems a lot. Coding has always fascinated me.  The sheer ability to transform seemingly meaningless lines of code into a full fledged solution to life and its necessity,  to know why , know how an application behaves each day feels like a dream, a miracle  and make no mistake,  i would make that transition again , a thousand times over because nothing has given me better satisfaction.
</p>
<p>


I bring a unique perspective to software engineering, including a strong attention to detail, a deep understanding of how systems work, and a collaborative mindset.
</p>

<p>

When I'm not coding, I enjoy gaming, reading, and watching football. I also love attending tech meetups <a href="" className='text-primary '> (Show me a conference)</a>  and conferences to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and connecting  with other developers.
